# Python
## Introduction
- High level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language
- created by guido van rossum, first released in 1991
- emphasize code readability with significant indentation
### why it is named as python
- monty python's flying circus
- benevolent dictator for life(BDFL)
### Design philosophy
- Aimed to be Successor to ABC language, appealing to unix/C Hackers
  - do one command perfectly
- focuses on readibility and simplicity("pythonic" code)
- syntax allows expressing concepts in fewer lines of code
### Major milestones
- python 2.0(2000): introduced list comprehensions, garbage collections
-  python 3.0(2008): Major revision, not fully backward-compatible, emphasized unicode support.
  - upto 2018 all the users have used python 2.0 only
### python 3 transition
- addressed fundamental design flaws, improved features
- gradual adoption by the community, supported by enhancements in python 2
- official end of python 2 support in 2020 accelerated transition 

### popularity & use cases
- package index(Pypi): over 200,000 packages
  - pip install -command
- extensive standard library and third-party packages
- scientific stack: Numpy, scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Framework: django, fflask, pyramid

### Applications of python
- web development
- data analysis and machine learnig
- automation & scripting
- scientific and numeric computing

``` 
python
### Type Conversion
- conveting integer to string
  - age_str=str(age)
- coversion of string to float
  - height_str = "5.11"
  - height_float = float(height_str) 
  ```
### 5 pillars of code quality
- readability - 75%
- maintainability
- extendibility   
- testibility
- performance
